Title: Web page generator project - Python 3.4 - Visual Studio Scenario: 

You have created a tool that can automatically create a basic HTML web page. 
The content on the page is hard-coded as "Stay tuned for our amazing summer sale!"

Your users have asked you to make it so they can set the body text. 
Your task is to create a GUI that will enable the users to set
the body text for a newly-created web page.  
There should also be a control in the GUI that initiates the 
process of making the new web page. 
You should be able to navigate to your 
newly-created .html page using a browser (Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox) 
and see the resulting web page. 

Guidelines:
Use Python 3.x, tKinter and Visual Studio 2013 for this drill.
